# Developer's log

## 26/04/24 Snapshot 24w17-2 Pre-Alpha V0.1
- get_travel_details function has been updated as new sub folder of location is created.
    ```def get_travel_details(self, location):
        with open(f'map/place/{location}/{location}.json') as json_data:
            location_data = json.load(json_data)
        return location_data

- Role assignment system have been implemented to the official discord server for Neslogaia.
- The New sub folder of location will include: channel_id.json, <location>.json, hut.json
and <location>.png as of now

### travel.py
- `travel` and `move` now requires the player to use it in their current place's channel,
which is in the bot's official discord server.
- Fixed bug whereby when `changedirection` is used immediately after `travel`, any more 
distance traveled using `move` will result in going over the Clik distance between the 2 places.

### player.py
- Added _hut_ to player data. This is to check if players have already visited the hut and give
the appropriate response (visit/visited).

### town.py
- `shop` command now requires the player to use it in their current place's channel,
which is in the bot's official discord server.
Eg: Player is in _Pigs_Plains_, so the player can only use the `shop` command in _Pigs_Plains_'s channel
- `hut` command has been added. Command also requires the player to use it in their current place's channel

There are many hut types in game Eg: _reward_,_battle_,_fun_.

| Hut type | Description                                    |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| reward   | Gives player something (coins, gear, weapon)   |
| battle   | Chance of getting into a battle with something |
| fun      | Random story texts                             |
- Only _reward_ has been added
- A maximum of one hut can exist in each place. Eg: Pigs_Plains has only 1 hut (_An abandoned hut_)


- Added get_channeldata function
```
  def get_channeldata(self, location):
      with open(f'map/place/{location}/{location}.json') as json_data:
          channel_data = json.load(json_data)
      return channel_data      
```

```commandline
    def get_hutdata(self, hut_location):
        with open(f'map/Place/{hut_location}/hut.json') as json_data:
            data = json.load(json_data)
        return data
```

- Added generate_valuetext function to get value text for embed in shop command
```commandline
    def generate_valuetext(self, item_type, shop_data):
        data = self.get_itemdata(item_type)
        valuetext = ''
        for item in shop_data[item_type]:
            item_list = list(item.keys())
            valuetext = valuetext + f"{data[item_list[0]]['name']}: {item[item_list[0]]}\n"
        return valuetext
```
- Added get_shopdata function
```commandline
    def get_shopdata(self, player_location):
        with open(f'shop/{player_location}.json') as json_data:
            data = json.load(json_data)
        return data
```

### combat.py
- Added calculate_level function to calculate player's level and to se if they leveled up.
```commandline
    def calculate_level(self, player_level, player_experience):
        with open(f'misc/levels.json') as json_data:
            leveling_data = json.load(json_data)

        for level in list(leveling_data):
            if player_level <= int(level):
                if player_experience >= leveling_data[level]['max']:
                    if player_level == 1000:
                        player_experience = 10000
                    else:
                        player_experience -= leveling_data[level]['max']
                        player_level += 1
                        if player_level == 1000:
                            player_experience = 10000
                    return player_level, player_experience, leveling_data[level]['max']
                else:
                    return player_level, player_experience, leveling_data[level]['max']
        print('Error, code should not reach here')
        return None , None, None
