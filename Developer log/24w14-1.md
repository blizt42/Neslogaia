# Developer's log

### 31/03/24 Snapshot 24w14-1
- Tidied up code for traveling commands
- added `battle` command under new COG Combat.py
- New player status added to player data
- Updated refreshplayerlist function to make it more neat

```
    def refreshplayerlist(self):
        print(f'[COG: combat.py][RefreshList] Getting playerlist.')
        self.playerlist = []
        for player in [p.stem for p in Path(".").glob("./player/*.json")]:
            try:
                self.playerlist.append(f'{player}')
                # print(f'Loaded: {player}.')
            except Exception as e:
                print(f'Error loading {player} profile. Reason: {e}')
        print(f'[COG: combat.py][RefreshList] Playerlist complete.')
```

-  added `flee` command to allow player to flee the battle in the case they feel they cannot win

> Need to add a function to reverse the direction of travel in any case the player decides to return.

> Is there a way to allow bot to check playerlist without refreshing list every time a command is used??

> Should separate the movement commands into their own COG. (travel)
