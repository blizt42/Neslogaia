- Decided to keep the bot as standalone without the use of dedicated server.
- removed guild_only decos and channel roles.

### town.py
- `port` has been added.

### combat.py
- `battle` loot system have been implemented
- Added calculate_Mobdrop function
```commandline
 def calculate_Mobdrop(self, mob):
        with open(f'mob/mob.json') as json_data:
            mobs_data = json.load(json_data)
        try:
            mob_data = mobs_data[mob]
        except Exception as e:
            return 'Mob error', e

        drop_percentage = random.randint(1,100)
        drop_item = random.choice(mob_data)
        print('----------------------')
        if drop_percentage <= drop_item[1]:
            print(f'DROP! {drop_item}, percentage: {drop_percentage}/{drop_item[1]}')
            print('----------------------')
            return drop_item[0]
        else:
            print('No drop')
        print('----------------------')
        return 'no drop'
